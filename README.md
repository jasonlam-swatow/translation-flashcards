# Translation Flashcards

A simple Vue 3 application for creating and practicing foreign language sentence flashcards. Add sentence/translation pairs to your library and review them with randomized flashcards that flip on click and support swipe navigation.

## Quick Add

Paste content like `==sentence==（translation）` into the library's quick add box to automatically split and format entries. For bulk entry, place each `==sentence==（translation）` pair on its own line and all of them will be added at once.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
