# Translation Flashcards

A simple Vue 3 application for creating and practicing foreign language sentence flashcards. Add sentence/translation pairs to your library and review them with randomized flashcards that flip on click and support swipe navigation.

While reviewing, flip to the sentence side to reveal edit and delete controls in the top-right corner of the screen.

## Quick Add

Paste content like `==sentence==（translation）` into the library's quick add box to automatically split and format entries. For bulk entry, place each `==sentence==（translation）` pair on its own line and all of them will be added at once.
